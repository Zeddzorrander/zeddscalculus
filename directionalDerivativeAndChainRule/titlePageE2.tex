\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Compute directional derivatives.
\item Use the directional derivative to show that the gradient vector points in the initial direction of greatest increase for the function. 
\item Compute the gradient vector of a function of several variables.
\item Recognize that the gradient points in the initial direction of
greatest increase of the functions value.
\item Reconize that the gradient is normal to level sets.
\item Compute directional derivatives.
\end{itemize}
