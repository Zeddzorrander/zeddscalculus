\outcome{Evaluate integrals using integration by parts, including mulitple iterations}


\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}
In a previous homework exercise, you were given the value of the \emph{definite} integral:

\[
\int_0^a x \sin(x) \d x = \sin(a)-a \cos(a)
\]

With the integration by parts technique, we are now able to see how to obtain this result:

Using integration by parts, we find the \emph{indefinite} integral:

\[
\int x \sin(x) \d x = \answer{\sin(x)-x \cos(x)+C}
\]
(Use $C$ for the constant of integration)

Using this and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we find that the \emph{definite} integral:

\[
\int_0^a x \sin(x) \d x = \answer{\sin(a)-a \cos(a)}
\]
