\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify second order differential equations and classify them as linear or nonlinear and homogeneous or nonhomogeneous.
	\item Given solutions to a differential equation, apply the principal of superposition to generate additional solutions.
	\item Apply the existence and uniqueness theorem to determine the intervals on which unique solutions exist to an initial value problem.
	\item Given solutions to a differential equation, determine if they form a fundamental set.
	\item Compute the Wronskian and use it to determine if a set of solutions is a fundamental set of solutions to a given homogeneous equation on a given interval.
\end{itemize}
