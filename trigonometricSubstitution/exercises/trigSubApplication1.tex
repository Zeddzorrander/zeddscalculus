\begin{exercise}
Determine the length of the curve $y=x^{2}$ on the interval $[0,1/2]$. 

We must set up an integral to determine the length. 

\[
\int_{\answer{0}}^{\answer{\frac{1}{2}}} \answer{ \sqrt{1+4x^{2}}} \d x
\]

\begin{exercise}

In order to determine the integral, we try a trig substitution.
Since we have a $1+4x^{2}$ term, we should use $x=\answer{\frac{1}{2}\tan(\theta)}$. 

This means that $\d x= \answer{ \frac{1}{2}\sec^{2}(\theta)} \d \theta$. 

We have two possible options. We could determine the antiderivative in terms of $\theta$ 
and then convert back to $x$ and then evaluate using our given bounds. 
Another option is that we could transform the $x$ bounds on our original integral to $\theta$ bounds. 

Using our substitution, we can convert our bounds.

When $x=0$, $\theta=\answer{0}$. 

When $x=\frac{1}{2}$, $\theta=\answer{\frac{\pi}{4}}$. 



\begin{exercise}


Now we can express our original definite integral as a trigonometric integral in terms of the variable $\theta$. 

\[
\int_{0}^{\frac{1}{2}} \sqrt{1+4x^{2}} \d x= \int_{\answer{0}}^{\answer{\frac{\pi}{4}}}  \answer{\frac{\sec^{3}(\theta)}{2}}   \d \theta
\]


First we calculate the indefinite integral $\int \sec^{3}(\theta) \d \theta$. Recall that this integral was investigated at the end of the section on trigonometric integrals. 
We derived the following formula using integration by parts:

\[
\int \sec^{3}(\theta) \d \theta=\frac{\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta)}{2} + \frac{ \ln| \sec(\theta) + \tan(\theta) | }{2} + C
\]

\begin{exercise}
Now evaluating our integral in terms of $\theta$ we have that the length of the given curve is given by

\[
\int_{0}^{\frac{1}{2}} \sqrt{1+4x^{2}} \d x= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}  \frac{\sec^{3}(\theta)}{2}   \d \theta =\answer{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{1}{4}\ln(\sqrt{2}+1) }
\]
