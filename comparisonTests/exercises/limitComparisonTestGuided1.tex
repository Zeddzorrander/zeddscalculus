\begin{exercise}

Consider the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2k^2+3k+1}{3k^3+8k+4}$.  

Is the series geometric or a $p$-series?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{The series is a geometric series.}
\choice{The series is a $p$-series.}
\choice[correct]{The series is neither a geometric series nor a $p$-series.}
\end{multipleChoice}

Let's think about the other most useful convergence tests.  Which of the following tests are \emph{applicable}?

\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{divergence test}
\choice[correct]{comparison test}
\choice[correct]{limit comparison test}
\choice[correct]{ratio test}
\choice[correct]{root test}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{hint}
The divergence test is always applicable; it has no conditions that are necessary to be applied. For the other tests, there is only one assumption!
\end{hint}

\begin{exercise}
Unfortunately, the divergence test is not conclusive since $\lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{2n^2+3n+1}{3n^3+8n+4} = \answer{0}$.  
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Would the Ratio or Root Test be a good choice to use here?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Since the summand does not contain a term that grows exponentially, the Ratio Test and Root Test will likely be conclusive.}
\choice[correct]{Since the summand does not contain a term that grows exponentially, the Ratio Test and Root Test will likely not be conclusive.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Would the Limit Comparison Test be a good choice to use here?  
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Since the summand is a rational expression in $k$, the Limit Comparison Test could be used.}
\choice{Since the summand is a rational expression in $k$, the Limit Comparison Test could not be used.}
\end{multipleChoice}

To find the series to which we will compare the given one, note the terms in the \emph{sequence} $\frac{2k^2+3k+1}{3k^3+8k+4}$.   

The dominant term in the numerator is:
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$2k^2$}
\choice{$3k$}
\choice{$1$}
\end{multipleChoice}

The dominant term in the denominator is:
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$3k^3$}
\choice{$8k$}
\choice{$4$}
\end{multipleChoice}

Hence, we can use the terms in the sequence $b_n = \frac{2n^2}{3n^3} = \answer{\frac{2}{3n}}$.  

\begin{exercise}
The limit we must compute is:

\[
L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} =  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\answer{\frac{2n^2+3n+1}{3n^3+8n+4}}}{\answer{\frac{2}{3n}}}  =  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{6n^3+9n^2+3n}{6n^3+16n+8} = \answer{1}
\]

What does the Limit Comparison Test tell us?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2k^2+3k+1}{3k^3+8k+4}$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{3k}$ either both converge or both diverge.}
\choice{$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2k^2+3k+1}{3k^3+8k+4}$ converges since the above limit is finite.}
\choice{Sine the above limit is not 0, the series diverges by the divergence test.}
\end{multipleChoice}

The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{3k}$:
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{is a $p$-series with $p>1$, it converges.}
\choice{is a $p$-series with $p>1$, it diverges.}
\choice{is a $p$-series with $p\leq1$, it converges.}
\choice[correct]{is a $p$-series with $p\leq1$, it diverges.}
\end{multipleChoice}

Hence, the original series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2k^2+3k+1}{3k^3+8k+4}$ diverges.

\begin{exercise}
Why would the Limit Comparison Test be preferable to the Comparison Test?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{To use the Comparison Test, we expect that the series will diverge and must use this to derive a careful lower bound for $ \frac{2n^2+3n+1}{3n^3+8n+4}$, whereas with the Limit Comparison Test, we can simply use $\frac{1}{n}$. }
\choice{There is no way to derive a lower bound for the Comparison Test.}
\end{multipleChoice}
