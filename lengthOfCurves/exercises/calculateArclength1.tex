\outcome{Set up an integral that gives the length of a curve segment and evaluate it}

\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}

Set up an integral with respect to both $x$ and $y$ that would give the length of the curve segment $y^3=x^2$ from $x=1$ to $x=8$.

The integral with respect to $x$ is:

\[
s= \int_{x=\answer{1}}^{x=\answer{8}} \answer{\sqrt{1+\frac{4}{9x^{2/3}}}} \d x
\]

The integral with respect to $y$ is:

\[
s= \int_{y=\answer{1}}^{y=\answer{4}} \answer{\sqrt{1+\frac{9}{4}y}} \d y
\]

Evaluating either of these integrals gives that the length is $\answer{\frac{8}{27} (10)^{3/2}-\frac{8}{27} \left(\frac{13}{4}\right)^{3/2}}$ units. (type an exact answer)

\begin{remark}
One of these integrals is easier to evaluate than the other!
