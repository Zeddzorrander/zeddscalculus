\outcome{Set up an integral that gives the length of a curve segment and evaluate it}

\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}

Find a value of $a>0$ so the length of the curve segment $y=\frac{2}{3}\left(1+x^2\right)^{3/2} +1$ from $x=0$ to $x=a$ is $17a$ units.



The curve has length $17a$ units when $a=\answer{2\sqrt{6}}$.

\begin{hint}
By being careful with differentiation and algebra, we find that an integral that gives the length of the curve from $x=0$ to $x=a$ is:

\[
s= \int_{x=\answer{0}}^{x=\answer{a}} \answer{ 1+2x^2} \d x \textrm{ (make sure to simplify your answer completely) }
\]

Evaluating this integral gives $s = \answer{\frac{2}{3}a^3+a}$ units.

Now set this equal to $17a$ and solve for $a$.
