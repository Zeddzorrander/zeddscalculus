\begin{exercise}
Consider the series:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{k^2+k}
\]

To determine whether the series converges or diverges, complete the following argument:

The first step to try to determine if a series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_k$ converges is to consider the sequence of partial sums, defined by $s_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k = a_1+\ldots + a_n$ for $n \geq 1$, and to try to find an \emph{explicit} formula for $s_n$.

To do this, start by finding the partial fraction decomposition of  the summand:

\[
 \frac{2}{k^2+k} = \frac{\answer{2}}{k}+\frac{\answer{-2}}{k+1}
\]

\begin{exercise}
Write out the first several terms in the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}$ using the partial fraction decomposition above:

\begin{align*}
a_1 &= \answer{2} - \answer{\frac{2}{2}} & a_2 &= \answer{\frac{2}{2}}-\answer{\frac{2}{3}} & a_3 &= \answer{\frac{2}{3}}-\answer{\frac{2}{4}} & a_4 &= \answer{\frac{2}{4}}-\answer{\frac{2}{5}}& a_5 &= \answer{\frac{2}{5}}-\answer{\frac{2}{6}}
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}
Find $s_1$, $s_2$, $s_3$, $s_4$, and $s_5$.  Pay attention for convenient cancellation!

\begin{align*}
s_1 &= \answer{2} - \answer{\frac{2}{2}} & s_2 &=  \answer{2}- \answer{\frac{2}{3}} & s_3 &=  \answer{2}- \answer{\frac{2}{4}} & s_4 &= \answer{2}-\answer{\frac{2}{5}}& s_5 &= \answer{2}-\answer{\frac{2}{6}} 
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}
We always have a \emph{recursive} formula for $s_n$:

\[
s_n = s_{n-1} +a_n
\]
 which in this case is:
 
 \[
 s_n= s_{n-1} + \answer{\frac{2}{n}-\frac{2}{n+1}}
 \]
 
Note that this does not allow us to determine whether the sequence $s_n$ has a limit; if it does and we call the limit $L$, by taking the limit of both sides of the above equation, we obtain:

\[
L = L +\answer{0}
\]

We can do better though!  By examining the terms that you wrote out for $s_n$, you should notice a pattern!  In fact, we can conjecture that an \emph{explicit} formula for $s_n$:

\[
s_n = \answer{2 - \frac{2}{n+1}}
\]
\begin{exercise}
By taking the limit as $n \to \infty$, we find:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = \answer{2}
\]
Hence:
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ converges but more information is needed to determine its value.}
\choice[correct]{The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ converges to $2$.}
\choice{The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ diverges.}
\end{multipleChoice}
