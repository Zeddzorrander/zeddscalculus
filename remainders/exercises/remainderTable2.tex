\begin{exercise}

Suppose that $\{a_n\}_{n=1}$ is a sequence and it is known that $a_1 =5$, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ converges and the remainder term is defined by $r_n = \frac{12}{n}$.


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c | c | c | c }
n& $1$ & $2$ & $3$ & $4$ \\ [2 ex]
\hline
$a_n$ & $ 5$ &$ \answer{6}$ & $ \answer{2}$ & $ \answer{1}$  \\ [2 ex]
\hline
$s_n$ & $ \answer{5}$ &$ \answer{11}$ & $ \answer{13}$ & $ \answer{14}$  \\ [2 ex]
\hline
$r_n$ & $ \answer{12}$ & $ \answer{6}$ & $ \answer{4}$ & $ \answer{3}$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{hint}
Note that we can find $r_n$ by writing out a few terms in the series represented by $r_{n-1}$ (which starts with $a_n$) and $r_n$ (which starts with $a_{n+1}$).

\begin{align*}
r_{n-1} &= a_n+a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+\ldots \\
r_{n} &= \phantom{a_n}  a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+\ldots \\
\end{align*}

As such, we have $a_n = r_{n-1}-r_n$ and since we are given $a_1=5$, these results completely specify $\{a_n\}_{n=1}$.
\end{hint}

\begin{exercise}
Find $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$.

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k =\answer{17}
\]

\begin{hint}
Note that for every $n$, we must have that $s_n +r_n = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$.  Using any value of $n$ in the table, we have that $s_n+r_n = \answer{17}.$  Note that we do \emph{not} have to find a formula for $s_n$ to determine this!
