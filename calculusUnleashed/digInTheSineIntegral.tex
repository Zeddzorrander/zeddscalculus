Here we will use facts about calculus to investigate a ``slippary''
function, one that is hard to get our hands on.

\begin{definition}
  The \dfn{sine integral} is most commonly defined as
  \[
  \si(x) = \int_0^x \frac{\sin(t)}{t}\d t.
  \]
\end{definition}


\section{What does the graph look like?}

We'll use all of our curve sketching techniques to try to understand
this function on the interval $[-2\pi,2\pi]$, as gesture of
friendship, we'll tell you that $\si(x)$ is continuous on
$[-2\pi,2\pi]$.  The first thing we should do is compute the first
derivative of $\si(x)$.

\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \ddx \si(x)
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    By the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
    \begin{align*}
    \ddx \si(x) &= \ddx \int_0^x \frac{\sin(t)}{t}\d t\\
    &=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

Now we'll compute the second derivative of $\si(x)$.

\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \dd[^2]{x^2}\si(x)
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    By our previous work and the quotient rule we see
    \begin{align*}
      \dd[^2]{x^2} \si(x) &= \ddx \frac{\sin(x)}{x}\\
      &=\frac{x\cos(x) -\sin(x)}{x^2}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

Now we should find the $y$-intercept.

\begin{example}
  Compute $\si(0)$.
  \begin{explanation}
    Here $\si(0)=0$, as $\si$ is an accumulation
    function, and at $x=0$, no area has been accumulated.
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

Now we'll look for critical points, where the derivative is zero or
undefined.

\begin{example}
  Find the critical points of $\si(x)$.
  \begin{explanation}
    The critical points are where $\si'(x)= 0$ or it does not exist.
    Since
    \[
    \si'(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}.
    \]
    We see that this derivative does not exist at $x=0$, and for $x\ne
    0$, $\si'(x)=0$ precisely when $\sin(x)$ is zero. Since $\sin(x)$
    is zero at $x = -2\pi, -\pi, \pi, 2\pi$, we see that the critical
    points are where
    \[
    x= -2\pi, -\pi,0, \pi, 2\pi.
    \]
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

We'll identify which of these are maximums and minimums.

\begin{example}
  Find the local extrema of $\si(x)$ on the interval $[-2\pi,2\pi]$.
  \begin{explanation}
    The critical points are at
    \[
    x= -2\pi, -\pi,0, \pi, 2\pi.
    \]
    We will use the first derivative test to identifiy which of these
    are local extrema.
    
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

Inflection points are harder. Let's try our hand.

\begin{example}
  Find the inflection points of $\si(x)$.
  \begin{explanation}
    We start by looking at the second derivative of $\si(x)$,
    \[
    \si''(x) = \frac{x\cos(x) -\sin(x)}{x^2}.
    \]
    The first candidate for an infection point is $x=0$, since the
    second derivative does not exist. To find other inflection points
    on $[-2\pi,2\pi]$, we need to find when
    \[
    x\cos(x) -\sin(x) =0.
    \]
    This is zero when $x=0$, anywhere else?
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}
